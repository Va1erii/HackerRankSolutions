/**
 * You will be given a square chess board with one queen and a number of obstacles placed on it.
 * Determine how many squares the queen can attack. A queen is standing on an n x n chessboard.
 * The chess board's rows are numbered from 1 to n, going from bottom to top.
 * Its columns are numbered from 1 to n, going from left to right.
 * Each square is referenced by a tuple, (r, c), describing the row, r, and column, c, where the square is located.
 * The queen is standing at position (rq, rc). In a single move, she can attack any square in any of the eight
 * directions (left, right, up, down, and the four diagonals).
 *
 * Complete the queensAttack function in the editor below.
 * It should return an integer that describes the number of squares the queen can attack.
