/**
 * David has several containers, each with a number of balls in it. He has just enough containers to sort each
 * type of ball he has into its own container. David wants to sort the balls using his sort method.
 * As an example, David has n = 2 containers and 2 different types of balls, both of which are numbered from 0 to n - 1 = 1.
 * The distribution of ball types per container are described by an n x n matrix of integers, M(container)(type).
 * For example, consider the following diagram for M = [[1,4], [2,3]]
