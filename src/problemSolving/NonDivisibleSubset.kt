/**
 * Given a set of distinct integers, print the size of a maximal subset of S where the sum of any 2 numbers
 * in S' is not evenly divisible by k.
 * For example, the array S = [19, 10, 12, 10, 24, 25, 22] and k = 4. One of the arrays that can be created is S'[0] = [10, 12, 25].
 * Another is S'[1] = [19, 22, 24]. After testing all permutations, the maximum length solution array has 3 elements.
 *
 * Function Description
 * Complete the nonDivisibleSubset function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing
 * the length of the longest subset of S meeting the criteria.
 *
 * nonDivisibleSubset has the following parameter(s):
 * - S: an array of integers
 * - k: an integer
